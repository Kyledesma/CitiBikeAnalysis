## Dataset
For my analysis on the CitiBike data in Manhattan, I chose to focus on July 2017 versus July 2018 data. I wanted to focus on July because it was the peak busiest month for Citibike, and I wanted to see how things changed after a year.


### Gender Analysis
My first dashboard takes a deeper look at gender. Based on the top graph, we can see that there are significantly more male riders than female riders at all ages. We saw the number of rides by a female increase from 460k to 543k. However, the number of rides taken by a female increased only .37%. In other words, while we did see a good increase in number of rides by a female between 2017 and 2018, males had a similar increase so the proportions did not change.

### Age Analysis
My second dashboard revolved around analyzing age. As expected, the majority of riders were between the age of 26 and 32. What I found interesting, however, was that older people (40-64) had higher trip durations on average. I think this makes sense when you factor in why people might be using citi bikes. With an average trip distance of less than a mile, it seems like the younger people are just trying to get from point A to B (in a hurry). WIth these older riders, it looks like they may be riding the bikes more for leisure/health reasons and are not in as much of a hurry.
